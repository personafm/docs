### App Directory

This directory holds the Next.js application itself. We use the Next.js App Router to handle routing so each page is a `page.tsx` file within a directory that serves as the route name. API routes are in the `app/api` directory.

### Components Directory

Shadcn components and custom components are in this directory.

### DB Directory

This directory holds the database schema and migrations.

### Lib Directory

This directory holds utility functions and other miscellaneous code.

### Supabase Directory

This directory holds the Supabase client and configuration for provisioning a database locally
