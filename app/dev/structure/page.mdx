### App Directory

The app directory is where most of the development work happens. There are are four main parts to the app directory.

#### API

```bash
app/api
└── <route_name>/route.ts
```

The api directory contains backend server routes named by the subdirectory names (ex. api/main/route.ts routes to `https://localhost:3000/api/main`).

#### Pages

```bash
app
├── ...
├── <page_name>/page.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── layout.tsx
├── globals.css
└── ...
```

A page route is specified by naming the directory which the page is in and adding a `page.tsx` in the directory. The index page will just be at `app/page.tsx`. Next.js also allows use of layouts. The `globals.css` file is used to store global styles and is Tailwind CSS's entry point into the styling of the application
