## Last.fm API

_This step is only required if you will be working persona generation features_

This project uses the last.fm API to get user data which is then fed into the OpenAI API to generate a persona

1. Generate a last.fm API key

   Go to [www.last.fm/api/accounts](https://www.last.fm/api/accounts), create an account if you havent already, then create an API key

2. Add the API key to your code

   Find the following values for your API account and add it to your '.env' file

   ```bash
   LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
   LASTFM_SHARED_SECRET=your_lastfm_shared_secret
   ```

## OpenAI API

_This step is only required if you will be working on persona generation features_

1. Create an OpenAI account

   Go to [platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an account if you don't already have one.

   Upon verifying your phone number in your [profile](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile). You should recieve $5 in API credits that you can use. If you don't recieve the credits, you can contact me at dev@personafm.com and I can temporarily provide you with a API key to use.

2. Create an API key

   Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key. Add it to your `.env` file. Your `.env` file should now look like this

   DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_db_connection_url
   LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
   LASTFM_SHARED_SECRET=your_lastfm_shared_secret
