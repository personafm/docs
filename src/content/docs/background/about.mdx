Persona.fm is an open source Next.js web application that utilizes OpenAI's API and Last.fm's API to generate music recommendations based on the listening history of a user for the last week. This project started as a way for the main developer to experiment with Generative AI, and has expanded into a full-fledged web application!

*This applicaton is in its alpha stages and is in active development, so please be patient with us as we continue to improve the application and prepare it for a public release.*
