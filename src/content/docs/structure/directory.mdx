title: Directory Structure
---

## This project uses the Next.js App Router 14.2.x

```bash
application
├── app
├── public
├── supabase
├── tests
├── utils
├── .env (untracked)
└── <various_configuration_files>
```

### App Directory
The app directory is where most of the development work happens. There are are four main parts to the app directory.

#### API
```bash
app/api
├── actions
└── <route_name>/route.ts
```
The api directory not only contain traditional backend server routes named by the subdirectory names (ex. api/main/route.ts routes to `https://localhost:3000/api/main`), but also actions that run in a serverless manner in `api/actions`.

#### Components
```bash
app/components
├── atoms
├── molecules
└── organisms
```
This project follows molecular structure in constructing components that are used on pages. You can read more about molecular structure [here](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). Within each of these subdirectories, you will find components that are used on pages, with only one component in each file

#### Pages
```bash
app
├── ...
├── <page_name>/page.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── error.tsx
├── layout.tsx
├── not-found.tsx
├── globals.css
└── ...
```

A page route is specified by naming the directory which the page is in and adding a `page.tsx` in the directory. The index page will just be at `app/page.tsx`. Next.js also allows use of layouts and various error pages. In this project, we have `error.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx`. The `globals.css` file is used to store global styles and is Tailwind CSS's entry point into the styling of the application

### Public Directory
```bash
application/public
└── images
```
The public directory is where static files are stored. This project currently only uses the public directory for images.

### Supabase Directory
```bash
application/supabase
└── migrations
    ├── <xxxx_migration_name>.sql
    └── meta
```
Here is where the PostgreSQL migrations for the database live. A migration tells the database to use the database schema to create tables in the database

### Utils Directory
```bash
.
├── helper.ts
├── supabase
└── types.ts
```

`helper.tsx` contains some helper functions used in multiple places, `supabase` contains files relating to authentication, and `types.ts` contains custom types used throughout the application

### Tests Directory
```bash
tests/
└── <filename>.spec.ts
```

This directory contains tests for the application. Each file can contain multiple tests.
