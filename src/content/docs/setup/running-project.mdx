## One last thing

Before running the development server add the following to your `.env` file: (Create an .env file in the root of the application directory if it does not exist)

```bash
URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the development server


```bash
cd application/ && npm run dev
```

The development server should reload upon any file changes. You may need to stop and restart the server upon changes to any configuration files

## Congratulations! You have successfully set up the project for local development! ðŸŽ‰
